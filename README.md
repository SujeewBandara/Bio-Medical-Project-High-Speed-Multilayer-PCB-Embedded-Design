# Bio Medical Project â€“ High-Speed Multilayer PCB & Embedded Design

This project highlights my engineering contribution to the development of a **fetal heart rate monitoring system** during my internship in the biomedical domain. The system was designed to monitor fetal **heart rate, orientation, kick count**, and **oxygen saturation**, enabling real-time health tracking in clinical environments.

### ðŸ§  Key Contributions

During this project, I was responsible for the **full PCB design and hardware integration** across multiple product versions:

- Redesigned and optimized hardware for **Version 2 and Version 3**, resolving all schematic and layout issues from Version 1
- Designed a custom **10-layer processor board** featuring the **TI AM62** system-on-chip
- Developed **six PCBs**, including:
  - 6*6cm 4-Layer Analog board to interface 10-layer processor board (AM62)
  - 4*4cm 4-Layer Analog board to interface Rock Pi S for sensor interfacing and signal processing
  - One SD card connector board
  - One shuttle board
  - One power/sensor interconnect board

- Designed **4-layer analog boards** with:
  - **Two split ground planes** (analog/digital separation)
  - **Two SPI buses**, one I2C bus, and a UART interface
  - **Impedance matching** and **length matching** for high-speed signals

- Participated in **clinical trials** to collect and verify real-time biomedical signal data
